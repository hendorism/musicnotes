<h2>About Aaron</h2>
Aaron Dull’s musical journey began in a household where music was a way of life. Growing up surrounded by family members deeply involved in music, he was introduced to the guitar, piano, drums, and harp from an early age. Although he initially aimed to follow in the footsteps of his father and older brother, both drummers, a surplus of drummers in his middle school band led him to choose the clarinet — a decision inspired by his love for Sergei Prokofiev’s <em>Peter and the Wolf</em>.

Privileged to be raised by a music educator, Aaron honed his skills studying violin with Janet Coleman, clarinet with Jodi Salzman, and piano with Maria Sier, all while learning the basics from his mother at an age when he had to reach above eye level to play.

As a teacher, Aaron is patient, enthusiastic, and reflective, tailoring lessons to each student's unique skill level and experience. His multi-instrumental background enriches his teaching, enabling him to incorporate a variety of musical styles and settings — from chamber music to experimental noise.

With over five years of experience performing in liturgical settings, community orchestras, and choirs, Aaron is comfortable working with everyone from adult beginners to seasoned professionals. His approach to teaching emphasizes written notation, improvisation, and both contemporary pop music and classical masterpieces. He believes that young students can grasp advanced musical concepts when introduced in an intuitive manner.

Dedicated to seeking new musical challenges and opportunities to share his passion, Aaron aims to inspire his students and enrich their musical journeys.
