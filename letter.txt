Hiring Manager
Auburn School District
Auburn, WA

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of School Bus Driver with the Auburn School District. I bring with me a strong sense of responsibility, calm decision-making under pressure, and a sincere commitment to the safety and well-being of students.

In my professional life, I have worked extensively as a music teacher, where I am entrusted daily with the care, supervision, and instruction of children and teenagers in both private and group settings. This experience has developed my patience, situational awareness, and ability to maintain a positive, orderly environment—qualities that I understand are essential for safely transporting students.

I take safety very seriously and understand that a school bus driver is not simply operating a vehicle, but is responsible for the lives of children from the moment they step on the bus until they arrive safely at their destination. I am dependable, punctual, and attentive to detail. I am comfortable following procedures, maintaining logs, and communicating clearly with staff, parents, and students.

Additionally, I am calm, courteous, and professional in my interactions, and I understand the importance of being a steady, reassuring presence for students each day. I am eager to complete any required training and certification and to become a reliable member of the transportation team.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Auburn School District by ensuring students are transported safely and respectfully. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you further.

Sincerely,
Aaron Dull
