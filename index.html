<p>Aaron Dull's journey in music began at a tender age, growing up in a household where music education was a way of life. Surrounded by a family deeply involved in music, Aaron was exposed to various instruments such as guitar, piano, and harp from an early age. His father was a drummer, his older brother became a drummer in the 6th grade, and Aaron intended to follow in their footsteps, but the middle school band had a surplus of drummers. So Aaron chose clarinet, which he knew and loved from Sergei Prokofiev's classic musical children's story Peter and the Wolf.</p>

<p>Having the privilege of being raised by a great music educator, Aaron was treated to the best available instructor, Jodi Salzman, wife of Tim Salzman, head of woodwinds at University of Washington. This was not the beginning of his formal music education however. Prior to this he had studied elementary violin with Janet Coleman. And he was taught the basics of piano playing and note reading by his mother at such a young age that he had to reach above the level of his eyes to play the keys.</p>

<p>As a teacher, Aaron is patient, enthusiatic and reflective, and tailors the material to every individual student's skill and experience level.</p>

<p>Aaron's strength as a teacher is in his multi-instrumental background, having been exposed to a variety of musical styles performed in a wide array of settings. Aaron is at home in chamber music settings and in grungy band sheds making experimental noise. Aaron has performed in liturgical church settings for five years now and participated in community orchestra and choir alongside everything from adult beginners to seasoned professional artists.</p>

<p>Aaron's approach to teaching is focused on written notation as well as improvisation, performance as well as theoretical analysis, and study of modern pop hits alongside the classic works of centuries past. He believes young students can quickly incorporate advanced musical concepts when presented in an intuitive way.</p>

<p>Aaron is always striving to find new ways to challenge himself musically and spread a love of music to his community.</p>
